            <p>
                My name is <strong>Parissa Parsania</strong> , I was born in 11.8.1988 in Tehran, Iran and I am married. <br> I have a master's in Chemical Engineering with 2 years of experience as a Tutor and 4 years as a Sales Support. <br> After migration
                to The Netherlands (by my husband’s Highly Skill Migrant Visa) on Oct 2019, I immediately started looking for a job in Sales which I had experience in. I attended many interviews and heard so many No! The main challenges were not knowing
                Dutch and not having work experience in The Netherlands. <br> But<em>Corona crisis</em> gave me the chance to start thinking about the changes I want to make in my life. <br> I had a very nice conversation with<em>Ms. Hilde Helsen</em>                , the author of <em>Dreams Who Do</em> , and she asked me to think about my dream jobs and dream companies to work. <br> It was the time I realized I was not the one who had decided for my university major and even my previous job (Unfortunately,
                due to the economic problems and the high rate of unemployment in Iran, people usually don’t have the freedom to choose their own path and follow their dreams).<br> So, I decided to take my life in a completely new direction; <strong>Programming!</strong>                <br> It takes courage to start something that puts you in a precarious state of uncertainty but I believe once you choose a (fresh) new start, something that is closer to your heart and your own path, it creates a certain drive and enthusiasm,
                which ensures quality and cannot go unnoticed. <br> Besides; <br> web developer position is usually among the Top10 most in-demand jobs in the world and it is one of the jobs that not only survived during the pandemic but also with the
                high demand for online education, remote learning, online shopping, and etcetera, there will be even more opportunities to work.<br> There is the possibility to work from home or abroad and work remotely for developers which are great
                advantages in the world's current situation. <br>My husband who is working as a frontend developer can be a great mentor for me. although he is busy working 8 hours a day, I have the chance to ask for his help when needed.<br> I have a
                proactive attitude, that's how I came up with simple codes for common assignments, saving time and avoid complexity. I am a fast learner who can find solutions independently, but I am also flexible and can work well in a team as I have
                the experience of working in an international team. Studying engineering made me more accurate with an eye for details. <br>To make sure if programming is the right choice for me that I can enjoy and be successful in, I started learning
                HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in Jun 2020 through online free websites and YouTube videos. <br>With my husband’s help, I have deployed this website as my own website which is still in very first steps but makes me more motivated to work and
                develop it.
